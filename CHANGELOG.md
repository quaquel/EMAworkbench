## 2.5.0
### Highlights
In the 2.5.0 release of the EMAworkbench we introduce a new experimental MPIevaluator to run on multi-node (HPC) systems (#299, #328). We would love feedback on it in #311.

Furthermore, the pair plots for scenario discovery now allow contour plots and bivariate histograms (#288). When doing Prim you can inspect multiple boxed and display them in a single figure (#317).

### Breaking changes
From 3.0 onwards, the names of parameters, constants, constraints, and outcomes must be valid python identifiers. From this version onwards, a DeprecationWarning is raised if the name is not a valid Python identifier.

## 2.4.0
### Highlights
The latest release of the EMAworkbench introduces significant performance improvements and quality of life updates. The performance of `_store_outcomes` has been enhanced by approximately 35x in pull request #232, while the `combine` function has seen a 8x speedup in pull request #233. This results in the overhead of the EMAworkbench being reduced by over 70%. In a benchmark, a very simple Python model now performs approximately 40.000 iterations per second, compared to 15.000 in 2.3.0.

In addition to these performance upgrades, the examples have [been added](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html) to the ReadTheDocs documentation, more documentation improvements have been made and many bugs and deprecations have been fixed.

The 2.4.x release series requires Python 3.8 and is tested on 3.8 to 3.11. It's the last release series supporting Python 3.8. It can be installed as usual via PyPI, with:
```
pip install --upgrade ema-workbench
```

## 2.3.0
### Highlights
This release adds a new algorithm for [output space exploration](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ema_documentation/em_framework/outputspace_exploration.html). The way in which convergence tracking for optimization is supported has been overhauled completely, see the updated [directed search](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/indepth_tutorial/directed-search.html) user guide for full details. The documentation has moreover been expanded with a [comparison to Rhodium](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/other_packages.html).

With this new release, the installation process has been improved by reducing the number of required dependencies. Recommended packages and connectors can now be installed as _extras_ using pip, for example `pip install -U ema-workbench[recommended,netlogo]`. See the [updated installation instructions](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html) for all options and details.

The 2.3.x release series supports Python 3.8 to 3.11. It can be installed as usual via PyPI, with:
```
pip install --upgrade ema-workbench
```

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/quaquel/EMAworkbench/compare/2.2.0...2.3

## 2.2.0
### Highlights
With the 2.2 release, the EMAworkbench can now connect to [Vadere](https://www.vadere.org/) models on pedestrian dynamics. When inspecting a Prim Box peeling trajectory, multiple points on the peeling trajectory can be inspected simultaneously by inputting a list of integers into [`PrimBox.inspect()`](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ema_documentation/analysis/prim.html#ema_workbench.analysis.prim.PrimBox.inspect).

When running experiments with multiprocessing using the [`MultiprocessingEvaluator`](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ema_documentation/em_framework/evaluators.html#ema_workbench.em_framework.evaluators.MultiprocessingEvaluator), the number of processes can now be controlled using a negative integer as input for `n_processes` (for example, `-2` on a 12-thread CPU results in 10 threads used). Also, it will now default to max. 61 processes on windows machines due to limitations inherent in Windows in dealing with higher processor counts.  Code quality, CI, and error reporting also have been improved. And finally, generating these release notes is now automated.
