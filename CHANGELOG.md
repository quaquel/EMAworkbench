## 2.2.0
### Highlights
With the 2.2 release, the EMAworkbench can now connect to [Vadere](https://www.vadere.org/) models on pedestrian dynamics. When inspecting a Prim Box peeling trajectory, multiple points on the peeling trajectory can be inspected simultaneously by inputting a list of integers into [`PrimBox.inspect()`](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ema_documentation/analysis/prim.html#ema_workbench.analysis.prim.PrimBox.inspect).

When running experiments with multiprocessing using the [`MultiprocessingEvaluator`](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ema_documentation/em_framework/evaluators.html#ema_workbench.em_framework.evaluators.MultiprocessingEvaluator), the number of processes can now be controlled using a negative integer as input for `n_processes` (for example, `-2` on a 12-thread CPU results in 10 threads used). Also, it will now default to max. 61 processes on windows machines due to limitations inherent in Windows in dealing with higher processer counts.  Code quality, CI, and error reporting also have been improved. And finally, generating these release notes is now automated.
