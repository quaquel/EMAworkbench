## 2.3.0
### Highlights
This release adds a new algorithm for [output space exploration](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ema_documentation/em_framework/outputspace_exploration.html). The way in which convergence tracking for optimization is supported has been overhauled completely, see the updated [directed search](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/indepth_tutorial/directed-search.html) user guide for full details. The documentation has moreover been expanded with a [comparison to Rhodium](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/other_packages.html).

With this new release, the installation process has been improved by reducing the number of required dependencies. Recommended packages and connectors can now be installed as _extras_ using pip, for example `pip install -U ema-workbench[recommended,netlogo]`. See the [updated installation instructions](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html) for all options and details.

The 2.3.x release series supports Python 3.8 to 3.11. It can be installed as usual via PyPI, with:
```
pip install --upgrade ema-workbench
```

## 2.2.0
### Highlights
With the 2.2 release, the EMAworkbench can now connect to [Vadere](https://www.vadere.org/) models on pedestrian dynamics. When inspecting a Prim Box peeling trajectory, multiple points on the peeling trajectory can be inspected simultaneously by inputting a list of integers into [`PrimBox.inspect()`](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ema_documentation/analysis/prim.html#ema_workbench.analysis.prim.PrimBox.inspect).

When running experiments with multiprocessing using the [`MultiprocessingEvaluator`](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ema_documentation/em_framework/evaluators.html#ema_workbench.em_framework.evaluators.MultiprocessingEvaluator), the number of processes can now be controlled using a negative integer as input for `n_processes` (for example, `-2` on a 12-thread CPU results in 10 threads used). Also, it will now default to max. 61 processes on windows machines due to limitations inherent in Windows in dealing with higher processor counts.  Code quality, CI, and error reporting also have been improved. And finally, generating these release notes is now automated.
