    "# MPIEvaluator: Run on multi-node HPC systems\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MPIEvaluator` is a new addition to the EMAworkbench that allows experiment execution on multi-node systems, including high-performance computers (HPCs). This capability is particularly useful if you want to conduct large-scale experiments that require distributed processing. Under the hood, the evaluator leverages the `MPIPoolExecutor` from [`mpi4py.futures`](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mpi4py.futures.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limiations\n",
    "- Currently, the MPIEvaluator is only tested on Linux and macOS, while it might work on other operating systems.\n",
    "- Currently, the MPIEvaluator only works with Python-based models, and won't work with file-based model types (like NetLogo or Vensim).\n",
    "- The MPIEvaluator is most useful for large-scale experiments, where the time spent on distributing the experiments over the cluster is negligible compared to the time spent on running the experiments. For smaller experiments, the overhead of distributing the experiments over the cluster might be significant, and it might be more efficient to run the experiments locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MPIEvaluator is experimental and its interface and functionality might change in future releases. We appreciate feedback on the MPIEvaluator, share any thoughts about it at https://github.com/quaquel/EMAworkbench/discussions/311.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Contents\n",
    "This tutorial will first show how to set up the environment, and then how to use the MPIEvaluator to run a model on a cluster. Finally, we'll use the [DelftBlue supercomputer](https://doc.dhpc.tudelft.nl/delftblue/) as an example, to show how to run on a system which uses a SLURM scheduler."

    "## 1. Setting up the environment\n",
    "To use the MPIEvaluator, MPI and mpi4py must be installed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Installing MPI on Linux typically involves the installation of a popular MPI implementation such as OpenMPI or MPICH. Below are the instructions for installing OpenMPI:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1a. Installing OpenMPI\n",
    "\n",
    "_If you use conda, it might install MPI automatically along when installing mpi4py (see 1b)._\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install OpenMPI using you package manager. First, update your package repositories, and then install OpenMPI:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   For **Debian/Ubuntu**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   sudo apt update\n",
    "   sudo apt install openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   For **Fedora**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   sudo dnf check-update\n",
    "   sudo dnf install openmpi openmpi-devel\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   For **CentOS/RHEL**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   sudo yum update\n",
    "   sudo yum install openmpi openmpi-devel\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Many times, the necessary environment variables are automatically set up. You can check if this is the case by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   mpiexec --version\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "If not, add OpenMPI's `bin` directory to your `PATH`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/openmpi/bin\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1b. Installing mpi4py\n",
    "The python package mpi4py needs to installed as well. This is most easily done [from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mpi4py/), by running the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -U mpi4py\n",

    "\n",
    "We recommend crafting and testing your model in a separate Python file, and then importing it into your main script. This way, you can test your model without having to run it through the MPIEvaluator, and you can easily switch between running it locally and on a cluster.\n",
