Exploratory Modelling and Analysis (EMA) Workbench
**************************************************

Exploratory Modeling and Analysis (EMA) is a research methodology that uses 
computational experiments to analyze complex and uncertain systems 
(`Bankes, 1993 <http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/171847>`_). That is, 
exploratory modeling aims at offering computational decision support for 
decision making under `deep uncertainty <http://inderscience.metapress.com/content/y77p3q512x475523/>`_ 
and `Robust decision making <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_decision_making>`_.  

The EMA workbench aims at providing support for performing exploratory
modeling with models developed in various modelling packages and environments. 
Currently, the workbench offers connectors to 
`Vensim <http://www.vensim.com/>`_, `Netlogo <http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/>`_, 
and Excel. 

The EMA workbench offers support for designing experiments, performing the 
experiments - including support for parallel processing on both a single 
machine as well as on clusters-, and analysing the results. To get started, 
take a look at the high level overview, the tutorial, or dive straight into 
the details of the API.
