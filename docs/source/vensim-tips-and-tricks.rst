.. _lookups:

====================
Dealing with lookups
====================

There are two ways for handling uncertainties about lookups. Either, one can
perturb the lookup table using Hearn's method. Alternatively, one can specify
one or more alternative functionalal relations that describe the relation
specified in the lookup, specify the various parameters of this function as
uncertainties and sample over these. 

.. _hearnes-method:

Hearne's method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the first case, `to be filled in`

.. using-a-function:

Using a function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The basic idea of the second approach is to use a function for generating the
lookup, the function is parameterized by one or more uncertainties. To
realise this approach, one will need to overide :meth:`run_model` in order to 
extract from the case dict the uncertainties related to the lookup, use a 
function to calculate the entries for the lookup, and add this lookup to the 
case dict.

Suppose that the lookup specifies some `S`-shaped relation that can be 
described using a sigmoid function. The basic sigmoid is:

.. math::
   
   P(t) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-t}}
 
This generates an S-shaped curve between 0 and 1, with 
:math:`P(0)=\frac{1}{2}`. However, suppose that our relation is uncertain,
but runs from arround -1 to arround +1 and :math:`P(t)=0` is also uncertain,
but is thought to be roughly 5, we can now modify the basic sigmoid by adding
three parameters to it that allows us to explore these three uncertainties. 
Suppose we call these uncertainties :math:`\alpha` for the upper bound, 
:math:`\beta` for the lower bound, and :math:`\gamma` for the value where
:math:`P(t)=0`.    

.. math::
   
   P(t) = (\alpha-\beta) * \frac{1}{1+e^{-t-\gamma}} + \beta

We can implement this function easily in Python. ::

    def sigmoid(t, alpha, beta, gamma):
        return (alpha+beta) * 1/(1+exp(t-gamma)) +beta
        
If we now add alpha, beta, and gamma as :class:`~uncertainties.ParameterUncertainty` 
instances to :attr:`self.uncertainties`. ::

   self.uncertainties.append(ParameterUncertainty((0.8,1.2), 'alpha')
   self.uncertainties.append(ParameterUncertainty((-1.2,-0.8), 'beta')
   self.uncertainties.append(ParameterUncertainty((4.75,5,25), 'gamma')

and override :meth:`run_model`.  ::

   def run_model(self, case):
      #get lookup related uncertainties
      alpha = case.pop('alpha')
      beta = case.pop('beta')
      gamma = case.pop('gamma')
      
      #make a new lookup
      newLookup = [(t, sigmoid(t, alpha, beta, gamma) for t in range(-10, 10)]
      
      #add the new lookup to the case
      case['name of lookup'] = newLookup
      
      super(self, ClassName).run_model(case)
      
       
Here, we first pop the three lookup relation uncertainties from the case dict.
We use these to generate a lookup with the specified sigmoid function. We
then add a new element to the case dict with the name of the lookup as key
and the new lookup as value. Finally, we call the super of :meth:`run_model` 
with the updated case dict. In this way, we are now able to explore the three 
lookup related uncertainties. 

.. _policies:

=================
Handling policies
=================

The default implementation of :meth:`model_init` provided in 
:class:`~vensim.VensimModelStructureInterface` does not do anything with the
`policy` argument. Therefore, if one want to explore the performance of one
or more policies, we will have to add some functionality to this method. This
can be done in many different ways. Here will shorty discuss two simple ways
for doing it: using alternative Vensim models and setting policy specific 
parameters on a default model. 


.. note:: 

   In both examples, we assume that we are dealing with a single 
   :class:`~vensim.VensimModelStructureInterface`. If there are model structure 
   uncertainties and we are using multiple different 
   :class:`~vensim.VensimModelStructureInterface` instances, these approaches 
   will not work as straightforward. Using multiple 
   :class:`~vensim.VensimModelStructureInterface` instances means that 
   for each basic vensim model, seperate policy versions need to be made. Than, 
   in each :meth:`model_init`, we need to identify the appropriate model file. 
   The parametric approach wil only work if each of the structurall different 
   models has the appropriate parameters.


Using different Vensim models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following modification to :meth:`model_init` allows us to use different
models for different policies. ::

   def model_init(self, policy, kwargs):
      #update the model file to point to the policy model file
      try:
         self.modelFile = policy.get('file')
      except KeyError:
         EmaLogging.warning('file not found in the policy dict') 

      # call super
      super(self, ClassName).model_init(self, policy, kwargs)
      
Here we assume that policy is a dict containing a 'file' key. The value 
associated with this key specifies the path tot the model relative to the 
working directory. The attempt to set the :attr:`self.modelFile` is surrounded
with `try` and `except` in order to be able to run the model without any 
policies. In that case, the policy dict will not contain the `file` key, 
resulting in a :class:`KeyError`. We catch this error and send a warning message
to the logger. After updating the model file, we can use the default 
behavior for starting Vensim and loading the model provided by :meth:`super`. 
With these modifications to :meth:`model_init`, we can now use this to 
explore the performance of multiple different policies across the 
uncertainties. ::

   policies = [{'name': 'policy1', 'file':r'\policy1.vpm'},
               {'name': 'policy2', 'file':r'\policy2.vpm'},
               {'name': 'base case', 'file':r'\base case.vpm'}]
   ensemble.set_policies(policies)

Setting policy parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following modification to :meth:`model_init` and :meth:`run_model `allows 
us to set policy related parameters. ::
 
   def model_init(self, policy, kwargs):
      # call super
      super(self, ClassName).model_init(self, policy, kwargs)
      self.policy = policy
      
   der run_model(self, case)
      for key, value in self.policy:
         if key=="name": continue
         case[key] = value
      
      super(self, ClassName).run_model(self, case)
 
The trick is to add the policy related variables to the case and use 
the normal procedures in :meth:`run_model` to set all variables in one go. 
Policies always have a name field, which we need to ignore, hence the check if 
key equals "name". We can now add policies to :class:`~model.ModelEnsemble` by 
assigning to the policies attribue ::

   ensemble.policies = [{'name': 'policy1', 'param1': 5,'param2': 1.2},
                        {'name': 'policy2', 'param1': 7,'param2': 0.8},
                        {'name': 'base case'}]              

.. _debugging:

=================
Debugging a model
=================
 
A common occuring problem is that some of the runs of a Vensim model do not 
complete correctly. In the logger, we see a message stating that a run
did not complete correct, with a description of the case that did not complete
correctly attached to it. Typically, this error is due to a division by zero
somewhere in the model during the simulation. The easiest way of finding 
the source of the division by zero is via Vensim itself. However, this 
requires that the model is parameterized as specified by the case that created
the error. It is of course possible to set all the parameters by hand, however
this becomes annoying on larger models, or if one has to do it multiple times.
Since the Vensim DLL does not have a way to save a model, we cannot use
the DLL. Instead, we can use the fact that one can save a Vensim model as a
text file. By changing the required parameters in this text file via the 
workbench, we can then open the modified model in Vensim and spot the error.

The following script can be used for this purpose.
