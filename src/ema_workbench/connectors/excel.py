    '''
    
    Base class for connecting the EMA workbench to models in Excel. To 
    automate this connection as much as possible. This implementation relies
    on naming cells in Excel. These names can then be used here as names
    for the uncertainties and the outcomes. See e.g. `this site <http://spreadsheets.about.com/od/exceltips/qt/named_range.htm>`_
    for details on naming cells and sets of cells. 
    
    The provided implementation here does work with :mod:`parallel_ema`.

        Method for running an instantiated model structures. This 
        implementation assumes that the names of the uncertainties correspond
        to the name of the cells in Excel. See e.g. `this site <http://spreadsheets.about.com/od/exceltips/qt/named_range.htm>`_ 
        for details or use Google and search on 'named range'. One of the 
        requirements on the names is that the cannot contains spaces. 

        For the extraction of results, the same approach is used. That is, 
        this implementation assumes that the name of a :class:`~outcomes.Outcome`
        instance corresponds to the name of a cell, or set of cells.

        Parameters
        ----------
        case : dict
               keyword arguments for running the model. The case is a dict with 
               the names of the uncertainties as key, and the values to which 
               to set these uncertainties.
