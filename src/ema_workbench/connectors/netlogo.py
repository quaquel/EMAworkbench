        ----------
        working_directory : str
                            working_directory for the model. 
        name : str
               name of the modelInterface. The name should contain only
               alpha-numerical characters.
               
        Raises
        ------
        EMAError if name contains non alpha-numerical characters
        
        Note
        ----
        Anything that is relative to `self.working_directory`should be 
        specified in `model_init` and not in `src`. Otherwise, the code 
        will not work when running it in parallel. The reason for this is that 
        the working directory is being updated by parallelEMA to the worker's 
        separate working directory prior to calling `model_init`.
