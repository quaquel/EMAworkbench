'''
This module specifies the abstract base class for interfacing with models. 
Any model that is to be controlled from the workbench is controlled via
an instance of an extension of this abstract base class.

    :class:`ModelStructureInterface` is one of the the two main classes used 
    for performing EMA. This is an abstract base class and cannot be used 
    directly. When extending this class :meth:`model_init` and 
    :meth:`run_model` have to be implemented. :meth:`src` should always
    call super to ensure proper functioning. The other methods are optional.

        ----------
        policy : dict

                 keyword arguments to be used by model_intit. This

        Anything that is relative to `self.working_directory` should be 
        specified in :meth:`model_init` and not in :meth:`src`. Otherwise, 
        the code will not work when running it in parallel. The reason for this

        directory of the worker
